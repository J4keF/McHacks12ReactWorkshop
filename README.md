npm --version
```
### React Installation / Bash Commands Needed
We will then install react using this command:  <br/>
```
npm install -g create-react-app
```
To create our first app run the following command:  <br/>
```
npx create-react-app <name_of_react_app>
```
Then navigate to the project folder using the following bash command:  <br/>
```
cd <name_of_react_app>
```
To view your project, once it is finished type the following command: <br/>
